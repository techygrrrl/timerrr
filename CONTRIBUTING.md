## ğŸ’½ Development

Run the following command to run the application:

    go run github.com/techygrrrl/timerrr

## ğŸ–¥ Requirements

- `go 1.20`
- [cobra-cli](https://github.com/spf13/cobra#usage)


## âœ… Testing

Run the tests with the following command:

    go test -v ./...

To run tests with coverage run:

    go test -v ./... -cover

Write any operating-specific tests in a file for that operating system, e.g. `os_utils_linux_test.go` will only run on Linux.


### ğŸ§¹ğŸ•¸ Linting

Use `goimports` for formatting and linting.

Install it:

    go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest

Run it:

    goimports -w .
